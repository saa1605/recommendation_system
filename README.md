Running main.py will train the matrix factorization model by default. To change this, pass the argument model_name='nn' in the call to main function in main.py

The main function, trains the rating prediction model. saves the model and the best predictions and the generates recommendation list of 10 items per user.

The main function exits by printing the performance of the trained model on rating predictions in the test set.

The loss graphs shown in the report can be obtained from the main.ipynb notebook.
